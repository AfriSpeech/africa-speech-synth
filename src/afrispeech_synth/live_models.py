"""The Gemini Live models that generate speech, and how each one behaves.

The Live API also exposes `gemini-3.5-transcribe-live` and
`gemini-3.5-live-translate-preview`. Neither belongs here: the first is ASR
(speech in, text out) and the second translates rather than reads, which is the
exact failure this pipeline's system instruction exists to prevent. Only models
that speak the text you give them are listed.

The notes are measurements, not marketing. Each was probed on one sentence in
five Ghanaian languages (Twi, Ewe, Dagbani, Ga, Hausa), scoring the model's own
transcription of its audio against the sentence it was asked to read.
